<p><b>What our users say:</b><br>
<i>"The main advantages of PGE mobile compared to many other tools are its flexibility with C++, low footprint (the generated APK is truly small), and performance. Itâ€™s genuinely the only accessible, easy-to-use mobile programming toolkit in C++ with an expressive and straightforward API (and a genuinely helpful community)."</i></p>
